# Discrete Mathematics I
These are my assignments for the Discrete Mathematics I course ([SMA0180](https://uspdigital.usp.br/jupiterweb/obterDisciplina?sgldis=SMA0180)) at ICMC-USP.

### Includes
- A recursive implementation of the Extended Euclidean Algorithm
- A program tha calculates fast modular exponentiation: $a^e\ (mod\ d)$
- A RSA cryptosystem with a 16-bit key (this uses both the Extended Euclidean Algorithm and the above mentioned algorithm to calculate modular exponentiation)

*Note: all the programs use command line arguments.*
